    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most known and love Italian recipes, <strong>carbonara</strong> 
       still divides people on the correct way to prepare it.</p>
    <p>Here, we present the traditional recipe: the creaminess of the egg cream is perfectly balanced by
       the crunchiness of guanciale, resulting in a delicious dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    (4 servings)
    <ul>
        <li>400 g spaghetti (or other pasta)</li>
        <li>200 g guanciale</li>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>120 g pecorino romano</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt a pot of water and put it on the heat; when it boils, put the spaghetti in it.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cut the guanciale into cubes, and cook it on low heat until it loses
            some of its fat and becomes crispy.</li>
        <li>Mix the egg yolks, the pecorino and the black pepper until you obtain a dense paste.</li>
        <li>After putting the pasta in the water, use some of its water in the egg cream: it should become almost liquid.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is done, mix it with the guanciale and, off heat, add the egg cream, stirring continuously until
            it becomes creamy.</li>
    </ol>
